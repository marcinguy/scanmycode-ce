  Open DevSecOps Orchestration Toolchain
</h2>


Scan your source code and infra IaC against top **security** risks

Betterscan is a orchestration toolchain that uses state of the art tools to scan your source code and infrastructure IaC and analyzes your security and compliance risks.

Currently supports: **PHP**, **Java**, **Python**, **PERL**, **Ruby**, **C**, **C++**, **Javascript**, **Typescript**, **GO**, Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) Security and Best Practices (**Docker**, **Kubernetes (k8s)**, **Terraform AWS, GCP, Azure**), Secret Scanning, Trojan Source, 

Open Source and Proprietary Checks

Checks for misconfigurations across all major (and some minor) cloud providers (AWS Checks, Azure Checks, GCP Checks, CloudStack Checks, DigitalOcean Checks, GitHub Checks, Kubernetes Checks, OpenStack Checks, Oracle Checks)


## Open and Developer friendly DevSecOps toolchain

Betterscan uses many tools for Code, Cloud, secrets, dependencies - SCA (software composition analysis) and Supply Chain Risks, and also precise Graph-based SAST analysis for Code and AI/OpenAI GPT. All the best Tools, researched, setup, ran together, unifed and de-duplicated results, **so you don't have to do it**. Added our own checkers also. Continuous Security. Fit for purpose and results.

# Quickstart



## **2 options** are available:

### 1. Binary runtime

#### CLI output

Run in command prompt in your Git repository folder:

`sh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tcosolutions/betterscan-ce/main/cli.sh)`

### HTML, JSON, SARIF output

The result will be in the current directory in "report.html", "report.json" and "report.sarif" file

Run in command prompt in your Git repository folder:
  
`sh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tcosolutions/betterscan-ce/main/cli-html.sh)`

### 2. Platform with Webinterface and workers

#### Docker

If you need CI/CD and Web Interface, you need Docker-Compose installed as well, if you don't already have it.

Run in command prompt:

```
git clone git@github.com:tcosolutions/betterscan-ce.git
cd betterscan-ce/dockerhub
docker compose up
```


Open up the Browser to:

`http://localhost:5000`
